# Amino acid reference sequences

Amino acid reference sequences are needed to align sequencing reads against. For conserved genes, such as mitochondrial genes, the same reference can be used for large taxonomic 
groups. References for all vertebrate and arthropod sequences exist e.g. for COI, which can be used captre most of the full COI gene for these groups. Only the slighly less
conserved beginning and end of these genes require more specific references.
